A bright planet looms
Dim stars speckle the dark sky
Burning so far away

Macala chitters
Looking for a mate perhaps
Watches from above

White cloud canopy
Green leaves reach for the sky
Yearning for the sun

Surveying its kingdom
An orange iguana lazes
Black stripes adorn him

Canopy of black
Blinding flash of a white sky
Rain will come tomorrow

Angry, caustic waves
Viciously stampeding
Stay out, they say
